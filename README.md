# anova2mqtt
Gateway between Anova cookers and MQTT based on [Ammar Zuberi's pyanova-api](https://github.com/ammarzuberi/pyanova-api).

## Note
Since the pip packet seems to be outdated, MIT-licensed pyanova-api's anaova package is included here. It will become a dependecy once the current version is updated on PyPi.
